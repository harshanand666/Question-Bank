# Question Bank

A simple terminal based question bank program using C++ which stores questions and their answers for various subjects.
I created this program as a project for my high school computer science class.

## Overview

This program enables multiple users to register and sign in to their own account. Once a user is signed in, they have the option to:
- Add a question
- Display all questions
- Display questions for a particular subject
- Modify a question
- Delete a question

User login information and question bank data is stored in .dat files
